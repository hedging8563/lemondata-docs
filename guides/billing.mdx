## Overview

LemonData uses **pay-as-you-go pricing**. You only pay for what you use, with no subscriptions or minimum commitments.

## How Billing Works

1. **Add credits** to your account
2. **Use the API** - costs are deducted per request
3. **Monitor usage** in your dashboard
4. **Top up** when your balance is low

## Pricing Models

### Per-Token Pricing

Most text generation models are priced per million tokens:

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|
| GPT-4o | $1.75 | $7.00 |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.105 | $0.42 |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $3.50 | $17.50 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $2.10 | $10.50 |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $0.70 | $3.50 |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | $0.875 | $7.00 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.1225 | $0.525 |
| DeepSeek R1 | $0.385 | $1.533 |

### Per-Request Pricing

Image, video, and audio models are priced per request:

| Model | Price per Request |
|-------|-------------------|
| DALL-E 3 (1024x1024) | $0.04 |
| Midjourney | $0.05 |
| Sora Video (5s) | $0.20 |
| Whisper (per minute) | $0.006 |
| TTS-1 | $0.015 |

## Token Counting

Tokens are the basic units of text processing:

- ~4 characters = 1 token (English)
- ~1-2 characters = 1 token (Chinese)
- 1 image = varies by size and detail

### Estimating Tokens

```python
# Rough estimation
def estimate_tokens(text):
    return len(text) / 4  # Approximate for English

# Actual count (for OpenAI models)
import tiktoken
encoder = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4o")
tokens = encoder.encode("Your text here")
print(f"Token count: {len(tokens)}")
```

## Usage Tracking

### Dashboard

Monitor your usage in the [Dashboard](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard):

- Real-time balance
- Usage history by model
- Cost breakdown
- API key usage

### API Response

Each response includes usage information:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 50,
    "completion_tokens": 100,
    "total_tokens": 150
  }
}
```
