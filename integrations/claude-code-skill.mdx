description: "5-minute quick start guide - Let Claude Code automatically integrate any LemonData API for you"
---

<Note>
This skill lets you integrate any of LemonData's **hundreds of AI APIs** by just describing what you need in plain English. The API is **Agent-First** — even if Claude guesses a model name wrong, the error response tells it exactly how to fix it.
</Note>

## What Can This Skill Do?

When you want to use AI features in your code (like GPT-4, image generation, speech recognition, etc.), this skill will:

1. ✅ **Try the API directly** — no searching needed
2. ✅ **Self-correct from errors** — structured error hints guide the next attempt
3. ✅ **Generate complete, runnable code** in your language of choice
4. ✅ **Pick the best model** based on real-time pricing and availability
5. ✅ **Optimize your integration** with native endpoint suggestions

**In short: Just describe your needs, and get working API integration code — even if the first attempt isn't perfect, the API guides Claude to the right answer.**

## Step 1: Install the Skill

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npx (Recommended)">
    The easiest way to install:

    ```bash
    npx add-skill hedging8563/lemondata-api-skill -y
    ```

    This will automatically install the skill to all detected coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Share GitHub URL">
    1. Open **Claude Code** in your terminal or IDE
    2. Paste this link in the chat:
    ```
    https://github.com/hedging8563/lemondata-api-skill
    ```
    3. Claude Code will recognize it as a skill repository and help you install it
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Git Clone">
    **Personal installation** (available in all projects):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hedging8563/lemondata-api-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/lemondata-api-integration
    ```

    **Project-specific installation** (shared with team via git):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hedging8563/lemondata-api-skill.git .claude/skills/lemondata-api-integration
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Verify Installation

Ask Claude Code:
```
What skills are available?
```

If you see `lemondata-api-integration`, the installation was successful!

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

Before using the skill, you need a LemonData API Key.

<Tip>
**You don't need to configure the API Key in advance!** When you use the skill, Claude Code will automatically ask for your API Key and include it in the generated code.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit LemonData">
    Go to [lemondata.cc](https://lemondata.cc)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    Create an account or log in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    Navigate to [Dashboard → API Keys](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/api) and create a new key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Key">
    Your key starts with `sk-...` - save it securely
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important:**
- All LemonData APIs use the same API Key
- Don't share your key with others
- Don't commit your key to GitHub
</Warning>

## Step 3: Start Using

Using the skill is as simple as chatting!

### Example 1: Using GPT-4

**You say:**
```
I want to use GPT-4 in my Python project
```

**Claude Code will:**
1. Try calling the API directly with the best model guess
2. If the model name is wrong, read `did_you_mean` from the error and auto-correct
3. Generate complete Python code with the correct model

**You get:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-your-api-key",
    base_url="https://api.lemondata.cc/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Example 2: Generate Images

**You say:**
```
How do I generate images with Flux in Node.js?
```

**Claude Code will:**
- Call the image generation API
- Generate JavaScript code with proper error handling
- Include image download and save code

### Example 3: Speech Recognition

**You say:**
```
Integrate a speech-to-text API
```

**Claude Code will:**
- Ask what programming language you're using
- Generate code with the correct audio endpoint
- Provide audio file handling examples

## Agent-First API Features

LemonData's API is designed for AI agents. Every error response includes structured hints:

### Smart Error Recovery

| Error | What the API Returns | What Claude Does |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Wrong model name | `did_you_mean` + `suggestions` | Auto-corrects and retries |
| Insufficient balance | `balance_usd` + cheaper `suggestions` | Switches to affordable model |
| Model unavailable | `alternatives` + `retry_after` | Switches to available model |
| Rate limited | `retry_after` (exact seconds) | Waits and retries |
| Context too long | `suggestions` with larger models | Switches to bigger context model |

### Model Discovery

No need to search documentation. Use these API endpoints:

```bash
# Read the machine-readable API overview
curl https://lemondata.cc/llms.txt

# List models by category
curl "https://api.lemondata.cc/v1/models?category=chat" -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-KEY"
curl "https://api.lemondata.cc/v1/models?category=image" -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-KEY"

# Filter by capability
curl "https://api.lemondata.cc/v1/models?tag=coding" -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-KEY"
```

### Native Endpoint Optimization

When Claude uses `/v1/chat/completions` with a Claude or Gemini model, the API returns optimization headers:

```
X-LemonData-Hint: This model supports native Anthropic format. Use POST /v1/messages for better performance.
X-LemonData-Native-Endpoint: /v1/messages
```

Claude Code will automatically switch to the native endpoint for better performance.

## Usage Tips

### 1. Just State Your Needs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Don't do this">
    ```
    Help me check if LemonData has an image generation API
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Do this instead">
    ```
    I want to generate images in Python
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Specify Your Language

If you have a specific language requirement, just say it:

```
Use JavaScript to call GPT-4
Use Python for speech recognition
Use Go to generate images
```

### 3. Describe Your Scenario

If you have specific needs, describe them in detail:

```
I'm building a chatbot, need to use GPT-4
My website needs to let users upload and transform images
I'm making a voice notes app, need speech-to-text
```

## Important Considerations

### API Key Security

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Never Do This" icon="xmark" color="#ef4444">
    - Put API Key directly in frontend code
    - Commit API Key to GitHub
    - Share API Key with others
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ Best Practices" icon="check" color="#22c55e">
    - Use environment variables
    - Call APIs from backend for websites
    - Use frameworks like Next.js, Express
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Cost Management

- Each API call consumes credits
- Set usage limits in your [dashboard](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard)
- Use small data volumes for testing
- Check `error.balance_usd` and `error.estimated_cost_usd` to monitor costs programmatically

### Error Handling

Generated code includes Agent-First error handling that:
- Reads structured error hints (`did_you_mean`, `suggestions`, `retry_after`)
- Auto-recovers from common errors
- Falls back to alternative models when needed

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Skill not triggering automatically?">
    Try mentioning "LemonData" or "LemonData API" in your request, or describe your need more specifically:
    ```
    Use LemonData to integrate GPT-4 in my project
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the API help Claude find the right model?">
    LemonData's Agent-First API returns structured error hints. If Claude guesses a wrong model name, the error response includes `did_you_mean` with the correct name and `suggestions` with alternative models. Claude reads these and auto-corrects on the next attempt.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generated code has errors?">
    Check these points:
    1. Is the API Key correct?
    2. Are required libraries installed? (e.g., `openai` for Python)
    3. Can you access LemonData's servers?
    4. Does your API Key have sufficient credits?
