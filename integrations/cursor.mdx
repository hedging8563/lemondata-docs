## Overview

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh) is an AI-powered code editor. You can use LemonData as a custom API provider to access 300+ models.

## Configuration

1. Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
2. Navigate to **Models** → **OpenAI API Key**
3. Enter your LemonData API key
4. Set the **Override OpenAI Base URL** to:

```

```

## Model Selection

After configuration, you can select any LemonData model in Cursor:

### Recommended Models for Coding

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Complex coding, architecture |
| `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` | General coding, debugging |
| `gpt-4o` | Code generation, explanations |
| `deepseek-r1` | Reasoning-heavy tasks |
| `gpt-4.1-mini` | Fast completions, simple tasks |

## Features

### Chat

Use the AI chat panel (`Cmd/Ctrl + L`) with any LemonData model:
