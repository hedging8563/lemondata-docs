## Overview

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh) is an AI-powered code editor. You can use LemonData as a custom API provider to access 300+ models.

## Configuration

1. Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
2. Navigate to **Models** in the left sidebar
3. Scroll down to the **OpenAI API Key** section
4. Enter your LemonData API key
5. Enable **Override OpenAI Base URL**
6. Set the Base URL to:

```
https://api.lemondata.cc/v1
```

## Model Selection

After configuration, you can select any LemonData model in Cursor:

### Recommended Models for Coding

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| `claude-opus-4-5` | Complex coding, architecture |
| `claude-sonnet-4-5` | General coding, debugging |
| `gpt-4o` | Code generation, explanations |
| `deepseek-r1` | Reasoning-heavy tasks |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | Fast completions, simple tasks |

## Features

### Chat

Use the AI chat panel (`Cmd/Ctrl + L`) with any LemonData model:

- Code explanations
- Bug fixing
- Refactoring suggestions
- Documentation generation

### Composer

The Composer feature (`Cmd/Ctrl + I`) works with LemonData models for:

- Multi-file edits
- Feature implementation
- Code migrations

### Tab Completion

For tab completions, we recommend using fast models:

- `gpt-4o-mini`
- `claude-haiku-4-5`
- `gemini-2.5-flash`

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Models not showing up">
    Cursor caches model lists. Try restarting Cursor after configuring the API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow responses">
    Check your model selection. Use faster models like `gpt-4o-mini` for quick tasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    Verify your API key is correct and has sufficient balance.
