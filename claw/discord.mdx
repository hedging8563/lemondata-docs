    4. Click **Reset Token** to generate a bot token

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Chatting">

    2. Complete the **pairing** process (enter the code in your Claw WebUI)
    3. Start chatting with AI!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using in Servers

### Group Settings

Configure server (guild) behavior in the **IM Integrations** tab of your Dashboard:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Group Policy** | Open / Allowlist / Disabled | Controls access to server channels |
| **Require @mention** | On / Off | Bot only responds when @mentioned (recommended) |
| **Group IDs** | List of guild IDs | Restrict to specific servers (empty = all servers) |

<Note>
Discord uses per-guild user allowlists instead of a global group allowlist. For advanced per-guild user filtering, configure directly in the OpenClaw config file.
</Note>

### DM Policy

Control who can send direct messages to your bot:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Pairing** (default) | New users get a pairing code — enter it in the WebUI to authorize |
| **Allowlist** | Only user IDs you specify can DM the bot |
| **Open** | Anyone can DM the bot (use with caution) |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot is online but doesn't respond">
    - Make sure **Message Content Intent** is enabled in the Developer Portal
    - Verify the bot token is correct
    - Check that the bot has permission to read and send messages in the channel
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bot shows as offline">
    - Check your instance status in the dashboard (should be green/running)
    - Try restarting the instance
    - Verify the token hasn't been reset in the Developer Portal
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="409 Conflict errors in logs">
    - This happens when two instances try to use the same bot token
    - Make sure only one Claw instance is configured with this token
  </Accordion>
