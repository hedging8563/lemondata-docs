Telegram is the **simplest** platform to connect. You only need a bot token from BotFather, and you'll be chatting with AI in under 2 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account
- A Claw instance ([create one here](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/claw))

## Setup Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Bot with BotFather">
    1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
    2. Send `/newbot`
    3. Choose a **display name** for your bot (e.g., "My AI Assistant")
    4. Choose a **username** ending in `bot` (e.g., `my_ai_assistant_bot`)
    5. BotFather will reply with your **Bot Token** — it looks like:
    ```
    123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
    ```
    <Warning>
    Keep your bot token secret! Anyone with this token can control your bot.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure in LemonData Dashboard">
    1. Go to your [Claw Dashboard](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/claw)
    2. Click the **settings icon** on your instance
    3. Open the **IM Integrations** tab
    4. Expand the **Telegram** section
    5. Paste your **Bot Token**
    6. Click **Save**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Chatting">
    1. Open Telegram and find your bot by its username
    2. Send any message (e.g., "Hello!")
    3. The bot will reply with a **pairing code**
    4. Enter the code in your Claw WebUI to complete pairing
    5. You're all set — start chatting with AI!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optional: Customize Bot Profile

After creating your bot, you can customize it with BotFather:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/setdescription` | Set the bot's bio/description |
| `/setabouttext` | Set the "About" section |
| `/setuserpic` | Upload a profile picture |
| `/setcommands` | Add command suggestions |

## Using in Groups

<Warning>
**Privacy Mode is enabled by default** for Telegram bots. In group chats, the bot will only see messages that:
- Start with `/` (commands)
- @mention the bot directly
- Are replies to the bot's messages

To let the bot see **all** group messages, disable Privacy Mode via BotFather: send `/setprivacy` → select your bot → choose **Disable**. Note: you must **remove and re-add** the bot to existing groups for this change to take effect.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot doesn't respond">
    - Verify the bot token is correct (no extra spaces)
    - Check that your instance is running (green status in dashboard)
    - Try restarting the instance from the dashboard
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Pairing code' not appearing">
    - Make sure you're sending a **direct message** to the bot, not in a group
    - The pairing system activates on the first message from a new user
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bot responds slowly">
    - Response time depends on the AI model selected
    - Larger models (GPT-4, Claude) may take a few seconds
    - Check your LemonData balance — insufficient credits will cause errors
  </Accordion>
