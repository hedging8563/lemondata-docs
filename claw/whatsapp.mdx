Connect WhatsApp to your Claw instance by scanning a QR code — just like WhatsApp Web.

## Prerequisites

- A phone with [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) installed and an active account
- A Claw instance ([create one here](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/claw))

<Warning>
WhatsApp uses your **real phone number**. Messages sent through the bot will appear as coming from your WhatsApp account. Use a dedicated number if you want separation.
</Warning>

## Setup Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open WhatsApp Configuration">
    1. Go to your [Claw Dashboard](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/claw)
    2. Click the **settings icon** on your instance
    3. Open the **IM Integrations** tab
    4. Expand the **WhatsApp** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan the QR Code">
    1. Click **Scan QR Code** button
    2. A QR code will appear (valid for ~60 seconds)
    3. On your phone, open WhatsApp → **Settings** → **Linked Devices** → **Link a Device**
    4. Scan the QR code displayed on screen
    5. Wait for the connection to establish
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Access Policy">
    WhatsApp uses the **allowlist** policy — only phone numbers you specify can interact with the AI bot.

    Add allowed phone numbers in the LemonData dashboard (international format, e.g., `+1234567890`).

    <Tip>
    Unlike other platforms, WhatsApp does not support the pairing mechanism. You must explicitly add allowed contacts.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Chatting">
    Send a message to the connected WhatsApp number from an allowed contact — the AI will respond!
  </Step>
</Steps>
