Connect WhatsApp to your Claw instance by scanning a QR code — just like WhatsApp Web.

## Prerequisites

- A phone with [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) installed and an active account
- A Claw instance ([create one here](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/claw))

<Warning>
WhatsApp uses your **real phone number**. Messages sent through the bot will appear as coming from your WhatsApp account. Use a dedicated number if you want separation.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**VoIP numbers are not supported.** WhatsApp requires a real SIM-based phone number. Virtual numbers (Google Voice, Skype, etc.) will not work for QR code pairing.
</Warning>

## Setup Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save WhatsApp Configuration">
    1. Go to your [Claw Dashboard](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/claw)
    2. Click the **settings icon** on your instance
    3. Open the **IM Integrations** tab
    4. Expand the **WhatsApp** section
    5. Configure the **Access Policy** (allowlist recommended)
    6. Click **Save** first — you must save the configuration before scanning the QR code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan the QR Code">
    1. Click **Scan QR Code** button
    2. A QR code will appear (valid for ~60 seconds)
    3. On your phone, open WhatsApp → **Settings** → **Linked Devices** → **Link a Device**
    4. Scan the QR code displayed on screen
    5. Wait for the connection to establish
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Access Policy">
    WhatsApp uses the **allowlist** policy — only phone numbers you specify can interact with the AI bot.

    Add allowed phone numbers in the LemonData dashboard (international format, e.g., `+1234567890`).

    <Tip>
    Unlike other platforms, WhatsApp does not support the pairing mechanism. You must explicitly add allowed contacts.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Chatting">
    Send a message to the connected WhatsApp number from an allowed contact — the AI will respond!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Group Settings

WhatsApp groups are supported. Configure group behavior in the **IM Integrations** tab:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Group Policy** | Open (default) / Allowlist / Disabled | Controls who can trigger the bot in groups |
| **Require @mention** | On / Off | Bot only responds when @mentioned |
| **Group IDs** | List of group JIDs | Restrict to specific groups (empty = all groups) |
| **Group Allowed Users** | List of phone numbers | Only these users can trigger the bot (allowlist mode) |

<Tip>
Use E.164 format for phone numbers in the group allowlist (e.g., `+1234567890`).
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="QR code expired">
    Click **Scan QR Code** again to generate a fresh code. QR codes expire after ~60 seconds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="WhatsApp disconnected">
    WhatsApp may disconnect linked devices after inactivity. Re-scan the QR code to reconnect.

  <Accordion title="Messages not getting AI responses">
    - Check that the sender's number is in your allowlist (if using allowlist policy)
    - Verify your instance is running
    - Check your LemonData balance
