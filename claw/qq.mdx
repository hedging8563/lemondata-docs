  <Accordion title="Bot not responding">
    - Verify AppID and AppSecret are correct
    - Check that your QQ number is in the sandbox whitelist (if testing)
    - Make sure the bot application is approved
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'invalid appid' error">
    - Double-check the AppID — it should be a numeric string
    - Make sure you're using the correct AppSecret (not the token)
