Add an AI assistant to your Slack workspace using Socket Mode — no public URL required.

## Prerequisites

- A [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace where you have admin access
- A Claw instance ([create one here](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/claw))

## Setup Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Slack App">
    1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **Create New App**
    2. Choose **From scratch**
    3. Enter an app name (e.g., "AI Assistant") and select your workspace
    4. Click **Create App**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Socket Mode">
    1. In the left sidebar, go to **Socket Mode**
    2. Toggle **Enable Socket Mode** to ON
    3. Give the token a name (e.g., "claw-socket") and click **Generate**
    4. Copy the **App-Level Token** (starts with `xapp-`) — you'll need this
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Bot Permissions">
    1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions** in the sidebar
    2. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, add these scopes:
       - `chat:write` — Send messages
       - `im:history` — Read DM history
       - `im:read` — View DMs
       - `im:write` — Start DMs
       - `app_mentions:read` — Detect @mentions
    3. Click **Install to Workspace** at the top
    4. Authorize the app
    5. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Events">
    1. Go to **Event Subscriptions** in the sidebar
    2. Toggle **Enable Events** to ON
    3. Under **Subscribe to bot events**, add:
       - `message.im` — Messages in DMs
       - `app_mention` — @mentions in channels
    4. Click **Save Changes**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure in LemonData Dashboard">
    1. Go to your [Claw Dashboard](https://lemondata.cc/dashboard/claw)
    2. Click the **settings icon** on your instance
    3. Open the **IM Integrations** tab
    4. Expand the **Slack** section
    5. Paste your **App Token** (`xapp-...`) and **Bot Token** (`xoxb-...`)
    6. Click **Save**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Chatting">
    1. In Slack, send a DM to your bot or @mention it in a channel
    2. The first user is **automatically paired** as the owner — no code needed!
    3. Start chatting with AI!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access Control

### Group Settings

Configure channel access in the **IM Integrations** tab of your Dashboard:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Group Policy** | Open (default) / Allowlist / Disabled | Controls which channels the bot responds in |
| **Require @mention** | On / Off | Bot only responds when @mentioned |
| **Group IDs** | List of channel IDs | Restrict to specific channels (empty = all channels) |
| **Group Allowed Users** | List of user IDs | Only these users can trigger the bot (allowlist mode) |

<Tip>
By default, Slack uses the **open** group policy — the bot responds in all channels it's invited to. Use **allowlist** to restrict to specific channels.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot doesn't respond to DMs">
    - Verify both tokens are correct (App Token starts with `xapp-`, Bot Token with `xoxb-`)
    - Check that `message.im` event is subscribed
    - Make sure the app is installed to your workspace
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bot doesn't respond to @mentions">
    - Check that `app_mentions:read` scope and `app_mention` event are configured
    - The bot must be invited to the channel first (type `/invite @botname`)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'not_allowed_token_type' error">
    - Make sure you're using the **App-Level Token** (`xapp-`) for the App Token field, not the Bot Token
    - The Bot Token (`xoxb-`) goes in the Bot Token field
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
