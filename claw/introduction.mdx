    Your instance comes pre-configured with popular models. You can customize which models are available through the instance settings.

## How Auto-Pairing Works

Most platforms (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu, DingTalk, QQ) use an **auto-pairing** mechanism for security:

1. The bot sends you a **6-digit pairing code**
2. Enter the code in your Claw WebUI at `claw-{subdomain}.lemondata.cc`
3. Once paired, you can chat freely — the pairing is permanent

<Note>
**WhatsApp** uses QR code scanning instead of pairing codes. **WeCom** uses webhook callbacks and does not require pairing.
</Note>

<Warning>
By default, only paired users can interact with your bot. You can change this in the DM Policy settings, but be careful with the "open" policy as it allows anyone to use your bot (and your AI credits).
</Warning>

## Managing Your Instance

Access your instance's WebUI at `https://claw-{subdomain}.lemondata.cc` to:
